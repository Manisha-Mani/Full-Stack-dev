    <h1>Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
    <p>Demo</p>
    <!--<script>
        Not a good practice to write JS code here.
        console.log('Hello, I am Manisha');
    </script>-->
    <p>If there is a logic to be executed on web, html doesn't work. Thus Javascript to create dynamic webpages.<br>
    The JS engine is in-built in the browser. It is like compiler which converts JS code to Machine code.<br>
    JS was intially only for client-side. JS engine is to execute and interpret. It just fetches data from server side, but execution is on client side. <br>
    The engine was taken and node.js was created which allowed us to do JS on server side too.<br>

    <h3>Constants and Variables</h3>
    <p>
        Variables is a container to store a value. Temporary memory location is assigned to a variable.<br>
        Constant is used to store fixed values. Keyword Const is used to declare. If you try to change that value, then
        there will be type error.<br>
        Datatypes are the types of values which can be stored in a variable:<br></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Primitive data types-5</li>
        <p>Numbers, strings, boolean, null and undefined.</p>
        <li>Reference data types</li>
        <p>Arrays, Objects, Functions</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conditional statements</h3>
    <p>Set of rules performed if condition is met.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>if-then</li>
        <li>if-else</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Loops</h3>
    <p>Loops are used to execute specific block repeatedly till some condition is met</p>
    <ul>
        <li>for loop-executes loop code till condition is met. Pre checks the condition. Has 3 parts- begin,condition,step</li>
        <li>while loop-block is executed while the condition is true</li>
        <li>do-while loop-variant of while loop, block is executed once before checking the condition, then executes again if condition is true</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Switch Case</h3>
    <p>Performs different actions based on different conditions. Exp in switch will be executed first and compared with case. The code block of matching case will be executed , otherwise the default one. Break keyword is used to terminate the loop</p>
